# Chess Analyzer
## Proposal
*Chess Analyzer* is an application that allows users to explore,
create, and save games of chess. Users can watch games progress
move by move, or can branch out and analyze their own variations.
It is designed for people who want to save games or moments and
replay them later, have a way to organize and analyze a collection
of games, and play unconventional positions and with rules that
would be impossible with standard rules
### Why Chess?
Chess was the original reason I became interested in programming.
After watching computer chess engines play (namely AlphaZero
versus Stockfish in 2017), I became fascinated with programming and
machine learning. This is my first attempt at writing any sort of
application or program for chess, which is something I have wanted
to do for a long time.
## User Stories

  collection of games

chess in the collection of games
